# Tidy_Data
This repository has a few examples of tidying data, based on Hadley Wickham's ideals. (here is a link to his paper https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

There will be more added to this repository, that cover different approaches to tidy different scenarios of messy data.

Prequisites
