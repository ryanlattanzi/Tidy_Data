    "# Tidying Billboard Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cute module, I will clean up some data to make it \"tidy\" in the words of the accomplished Hadley Wickham. The work is based on his paper https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf, which defines tidy data as \"structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.\" It is important to note that although the tidy data may not be the best form to store in a database (we will often find duplications of some kind), it is perhaps the optimal way to massage it to feed it into our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use pandas to melt this dataset to get it in tidy form which consists of these three principles from Wickham's paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each variable forms a column.\n",
    "    - Each observation forms a row.\n",
    "    - Each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Before we take on this project, I'll tell you a little bit about the dataset. It has shape $(317,81)$, where each row represents a song that has features year, artist, track, name, date entered, and $76$ weeks that show the rank of the song if it has entered the top $100$. If the song drops off the top $100$ list, its rank will be substituted with a NaN. Relatively straight forward, but a perfect example for some tidying.\n",
